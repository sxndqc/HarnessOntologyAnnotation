# Task: the UMR of a whole document

You annotate a whole document in Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR): every sentence's sentence-level
graph, then all the document-level relations (temporal, modal, coreference) of the document. The document
is under **Input** at the end, one sentence per line. Work in this directory only; the files you need are
listed under Files. Write the answer to `answer.txt` (see Output format). You may keep notes in `notes/`.

**Make the annotation as correct as you can.** It is compared, node by node and relation by relation,
with an expert gold annotation made by these guidelines, so every concept, sense, role, attribute value
and document-level relation counts. Take the time this needs:

- Read the guidelines carefully before you start, and go back to them for every decision you are not
  sure of: the concept and its sense, the numbered and non-core roles, abstract concepts and named
  entities, aspect, modal strength, polarity, and the temporal, modal and coreference relations.
- Follow the examples: when a sentence has a construction an example shows, annotate it the way the
  example does.
- Do not guess when you can check: look up how the gold data annotates a construction, a word or a
  relation (`tools/search_annotations.py`). Look things up as often as you need: many lookups are
  expected.
- Before you go on to the next sentence, check the graph against the guidelines once more: every word
  that carries meaning has its concept, every event its aspect, every role the right direction; and at
  the end check that the document-level relations cover every event and entity the guidelines ask for.

## Files

- `guidelines/umr_guidelines_abridged.md`: the UMR guidelines, abridged (about 14,000 characters). Read
  all of it before you start.
- `tools/`: commands (run them with Bash, from this directory):

`python3 tools/search_annotations.py --language {lang} KEYWORD [KEYWORD ...] [--max N]` prints gold UMR
annotations of whole training sentences (other documents) that contain the keywords (at most N, 1-10,
default 3): words of the text, concepts (`have-org-role-92`), roles (`:ARG1-of`), attribute values
(`:aspect state`), document-level relations (`:same-entity`). They are annotated by the same experts as
the gold you are compared with: for each sentence, look up the words and constructions you are not sure
of before you annotate it, and follow what the gold does.

## Output format

Write plain text only (no JSON, no commentary). For every sentence, in order:

    # ::snt 1
    # sentence level graph:
    (s1t / taste-01
        :ARG0 (s1p / person
            :name (s1n / name :op1 "Edmund" :op2 "Pope"))
        :ARG1 (s1f / free-04
            :ARG1 s1p
            :aspect state)
        :temporal (s1t2 / today)
        :aspect performance)

then, once, after the last sentence, every document-level relation of the whole document in one graph:

    # document level relations:
    (d / document
        :temporal ((document-creation-time :depends-on s1t2)
                   (s1t2 :contained s1t)
                   (s1t :before s2c))
        :modal ((root :modal author)
                (author :full-affirmative s1t)
                (author :full-affirmative s2c))
        :coref ((s1p :same-entity s2p)))

- `# ::snt N` uses the sentence number of the input line. Every sentence gets a graph, even a short one.
- Variables of sentence N start with `s` + N and a letter (`s3p`, `s3x2`), all different. A node that
  fills two roles in one sentence is written once and then named by its variable.
- No word alignment: it is computed from the graph. So a concept that comes from a word of the sentence
  is written as that word (in English its lemma: `taste-01` for "tasted"), and the `:op` strings of a
  name are the words of the name as the sentence writes them.
- Document level: `(parent :relation child)` triples, grouped under `:temporal`, `:modal`, `:coref`;
  each end is a variable of a sentence graph or a constant (`author`, `root`, `document-creation-time`,
  `past-reference`, `present-reference`, `future-reference`, `null-conceiver`).
- Use the names of the UMR release data: `author` (not AUTH), `document-creation-time` (not DCT),
  `full-affirmative`, `partial-affirmative`, `neutral-affirmative`, `neutral-negative`,
  `partial-negative`, `full-negative`, `unspecified` (not FullAff, ...), `:modal-strength` (not
  :modstr), `:refer-person` / `:refer-number` with lower-case values (`3rd`, `singular`), and lower-case
  aspect values (`performance`, `state`, ...).
- Write the answer to `answer.txt` in this directory: every sentence, then the document-level
  relations, in the format above, nothing else. It is long; you may write it in parts (for example
  sentence by sentence, adding to the file), but at the end the file must hold the whole answer.
- Write the whole document: do not stop early, do not summarise, do not skip sentences.

## Input

Language: {lang}
Document: {doc_id} ({n} sentences)
