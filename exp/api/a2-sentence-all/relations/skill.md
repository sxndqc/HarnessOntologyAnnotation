# Skill: the document-level relations of one sentence

You add the UMR document-level relations (temporal, modal, coreference) of one sentence of a document.
Every sentence of the document already has its sentence-level graph. Under **Input** at the end you get
this sentence and the sentences before it (at most five) with their graphs.

**Make the annotation as correct as you can.** It is compared, relation by relation, with an expert gold
annotation made by these guidelines, so every temporal, modal and coreference relation counts. Take the
time this needs:

- Read the guidelines below carefully before you start, and go back to them for every decision you are
  not sure of: which events and entities get which relations, their reference times, conceivers and
  modal strengths, and which nodes corefer.
- Follow the examples: when the sentence has a case an example shows, annotate it the way the example
  does.
- Do not guess when you can check: use the tools (see Tools): search the full guidelines with
  `search_guidelines` for the rules of temporal, modal and coreference relations, look up how the gold
  data annotates such relations with `search_annotations` (e.g. `:same-entity`, `:depends-on`,
  `:full-affirmative`), and look a predicate up with `propbank_lookup` whenever its meaning matters for a
  relation. Call them as often as you need.
- Before you answer, check that the relations cover every event and entity of this sentence that the
  guidelines ask for.

## Guidelines

{guideline}

## Output format

Write plain text only (no JSON, no commentary): the document-level relations of this sentence (number N)
in one graph, for example for sentence 2:

    # document level relations:
    (d / document
        :temporal ((s1t :before s2t)
                   (document-creation-time :overlap s2s))
        :modal ((root :modal author)
                (author :full-affirmative s2t)
                (author :full-affirmative s2s))
        :coref ((s1p :same-entity s2p)))

- The relations of this sentence are those in which a node of sentence N takes part: with a constant
  (`author`, `root`, `document-creation-time`, `past-reference`, `present-reference`,
  `future-reference`, `null-conceiver`), with another node of sentence N, or with a node of one of the
  previous sentences given (for example coreference with an earlier mention, or an event of this sentence
  ordered after an event of the previous one). Do not repeat relations among the previous sentences only.
- `(parent :relation child)` triples, grouped under `:temporal`, `:modal`, `:coref`; each end is a
  variable of the graphs given, exactly as written there, or a constant.
- Use the names of the UMR release data: `author` (not AUTH), `document-creation-time` (not DCT),
  `full-affirmative`, ..., `unspecified` (not FullAff, ...).
- If the sentence has no document-level relation, write the graph with empty groups: `(d / document)`.

## Tools

`search_guidelines(keywords, max_results)` searches the **full** UMR guidelines (umr4nlp/umr-guidelines,
the document the guidelines above abridge) and returns the matching passages with their headings, with
their examples. The abridged guidelines leave out most details and examples, so use it a lot: look a rule
up whenever you are not sure of a case (an abstract concept, a role, a named entity type, an aspect or modal
value, a temporal or coreference decision), and look up each kind of construction the document has before
you annotate it. Search with the terms the guidelines would use (`aspect`, `have-rel-role-92`, `:quant`,
`modal strength`, `reentrancy`). Note that the full guidelines often write the older short names (AUTH,
DCT, FullAff, :modstr); your answer uses the release names listed under Output format.

`search_annotations(language, keywords, max_results)` returns gold UMR annotations of whole sentences of the
training data (other documents) that contain the keywords: words of the text, concepts (`have-org-role-92`), roles
(`:ARG1-of`), attribute values (`:aspect state`), document-level relations (`:same-entity`). These are
annotated by the same experts as the gold you are compared with, so they show how this data annotates a
case. Use it a lot: for each sentence, look up its words and constructions you are not sure of (a word's
concept and sense, a light verb, a modal word, a named entity, a comparison, a quantity, a discourse
relation, the aspect of a kind of event) before you annotate it, and follow what the gold does.

`propbank_lookup(lemmas, language)` returns the PropBank rolesets of up to 20 lemmas per call (Chinese
PropBank for "zh", English PropBank for "en"): each roleset's id, its numbered roles and its examples.
Use it when the meaning of a predicate decides a relation.
