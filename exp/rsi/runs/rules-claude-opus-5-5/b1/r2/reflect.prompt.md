You are improving the instruction an annotator (a model) follows to annotate whole documents in Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR). It is scored against expert gold annotations; the score that counts is AnCast++ (sentence graphs and document-level relations). Below are the current instruction, a critique of its annotation of a training batch, and what earlier edits did.

Edit the instruction to fix the problems of the critique that will recur on other documents. Prefer few, high-value changes; keep what works; keep the instruction clear and consistent (fix a rule rather than adding a contradicting one). The output format and the tools' descriptions are fixed and not part of the instruction: do not restate or change them. The instruction may be at most 30000 characters (now 19890). Never copy text of the test documents. Write general rules only. Do not record details: no specific words, names, sentences or annotations of these sentences, and no examples taken from them (short schematic patterns such as X 的 Y or (x / ...-01 :ARG0 ...) are fine). An edit that copies 8 or more characters of the training document is rejected.

# The current instruction

# Skill: the UMR of a whole document

You annotate a whole document in Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR): every sentence's sentence-level
graph, then all the document-level relations (temporal, modal, coreference) of the document. The document
is under **Input** at the end, one sentence per line.

**Make the annotation as correct as you can.** It is compared, node by node and relation by relation,
with an expert gold annotation made by these guidelines, so every concept, sense, role, attribute value
and document-level relation counts. Take the time this needs:

- Read the guidelines below carefully before you start, and go back to them for every decision you are
  not sure of: the concept and its sense, the numbered and non-core roles, abstract concepts and named
  entities, aspect, modal strength, polarity, and the temporal, modal and coreference relations.
- Follow the examples: when a sentence has a construction an example shows, annotate it the way the
  example does.
- Do not guess when you can check: use the three tools (see Tools): search the full guidelines with
  `search_guidelines` whenever the guidelines above do not settle a case, look up every predicate in
  PropBank with `propbank_lookup` before you choose its sense and numbered roles, and look up how the gold
  data annotates a construction, a word or a relation with `search_annotations`. Call them as often as you
  need: many calls are expected.
- Before you go on to the next sentence, check the graph against the guidelines once more: every word
  that carries meaning has its concept, every event its aspect, every role the right direction; and at
  the end check that the document-level relations cover every event and entity the guidelines ask for.

## Guidelines

# UMR guidelines, abridged

A short version of the UMR 0.9 specification (`umr_guidelines.md` in this folder, umr4nlp/umr-guidelines),
for annotating Chinese and English at Stage 1 (numbered PropBank roles). It keeps what an annotator needs for
most sentences and leaves out the typological material, the fine-grained lattices, the field-linguistics
sections and most of the examples. Where the full guideline uses the older short names (`AUTH`, `DCT`,
`FullAff`, `:modstr`, `:ref-person`, `Performance`), this version uses the names of the UMR release data
(`author`, `document-creation-time`, `full-affirmative`, `:modal-strength`, `:refer-person`, `performance`).

## 1. What a UMR is

A UMR has two levels.

- **Sentence level**: one rooted, directed graph per sentence in PENMAN notation, adapted from AMR:
  concepts (events, entities, abstract concepts), the relations between them (participant roles and
  non-participant roles) and attributes (aspect, polarity, mode, quantity, person and number, degree).
- **Document level**: three kinds of relations between the nodes of the sentence graphs, across sentences:
  **temporal** dependencies, **modal** dependencies, and **coreference**.

```
He denied any wrongdoing.

(s3d / deny-01
    :ARG0 (s3p / person
        :refer-person 3rd
        :refer-number singular)
    :ARG1 (s3d2 / do-02
        :ARG0 s3p
        :ARG1 (s3t / thing
            :mod (s3a / any)
            :ARG1-of (s3w / wrong-02))
        :aspect process)
    :aspect performance)

(s3s0 / sentence
    :temporal ((document-creation-time :before s3d)
               (s3d :before s3d2))
    :modal ((root :modal author)
            (author :full-affirmative s3p)
            (s3p :full-affirmative s3d)
            (s3d :unspecified s3d2))
    :coref ((s2p :same-entity s3p)))
```

**Variables.** Every node of sentence N has a variable starting with `s` + N (`s3d`, `s3p`, `s3d2`), all
different within the document. A node that fills two roles is written once and then referred to by its
variable (re-entrancy: `:ARG0 s3p` above).

## 2. Concepts

### 2.1 Events

An event is a process or a state that is **predicated**, or a process used to **refer or modify**:

- verbs used as predicates (`deny-01`, Chinese `拥有-01`);
- event nominals with process meaning (*the meeting*, *the attack*, 会议, 比赛) — annotate them as events;
- participles and relative-clause verbs (*the man who left*: `(p / person :ARG0-of (l / leave-11))`);
- predicated states: adjectives and nouns in predicate position (*he is tall*, 他很高) — through the
  abstract predicates of 2.3 when there is no lexical verb.

Not events: entity nouns, property words used as plain modifiers (*a tall man*: `:mod (t / tall)`),
auxiliaries and modal verbs (*will, can, must*; 会, 能, 可以, 应该 — they affect `:aspect` and modal
strength, they are not nodes), light verbs (*make a decision* → `decide-01`; 进行访问 → `访问-01`),
the copula (*be*, 是) — it becomes one of the abstract predicates.

**Concept names.** An English event is its PropBank roleset (`deny-01`, `look-up-05`). A Chinese event is the
Chinese word as written with its Chinese PropBank sense (`拥有-01`, `执行-01`); a Chinese predicate that is not
in PropBank is `<word>-00`. Entities and modifiers are the word itself, lemmatized in English (`doctor`, `health`) and as
written in Chinese (`宇航员`, `航天器`). Use English only for the abstract concepts below and for entity
types (`person`, `thing`, `country`, `city`, `organization`, ...).

### 2.2 Named entities

`(c / country :wiki "Russia" :name (n / name :op1 "Russia"))`: an entity-type concept, an optional `:wiki`
(the Wikipedia title, or `-` when there is none), and `:name` with one `:opN` per word of the name.
Chinese names are split into words, not characters: 欧洲议会 → `:op1 "欧洲" :op2 "议会"`. Types: `person`,
`country`, `city`, `province`, `state`, `nationality`, `ethnic-group`, `language`, `organization`,
`company`, `government-organization`, `political-party`, `university`, `newspaper`, `publication`, `river`,
`mountain`, `building`, `airport`, `road`, `event`, `war`, `conference`, `festival`, `award`, `law`,
`disease`, `product`, `spaceship`, ... (as in AMR).

Dates: `(d / date-entity :year 1998 :month 4 :day 3)`, also `:weekday`, `:season`, `:dayperiod`, `:era`,
`:decade`, `:century`. Durations and amounts: `(t / temporal-quantity :quant 3 :unit (y / year))`,
`(m / monetary-quantity :quant 500 :unit (d / dollar))`. Ordinals: `(o / ordinal-entity :value 2)`.
Numbers are written as digits. In Chinese, a numeral + measure word or classifier keeps the classifier as the unit,
ordinary classifiers included (个, 本, 只, 位, 份, 面): 三杯水 → `水 :quant 3 :unit 杯`, 一本书 → `书 :quant 1 :unit (s / 本)`.
A demonstrative + classifier (这个, 那份) also keeps the classifier as `:unit`.
The title marks of a work or publication name (《 and 》) are part of the name: `:op1 "《"`, then the words, then a last `:opN "》"`.

### 2.3 Abstract predicates (non-verbal clauses)

| construction | concept | roles |
|---|---|---|
| X is Y (identity, equation) | `identity-91` | `:ARG1` X, `:ARG2` Y |
| X is Adj / X has property | `have-mod-91` | `:ARG1` theme, `:ARG2` property |
| X is in/at place | `have-place-91` | `:ARG1` theme, `:ARG2` place |
| X has Y (possession) | `have-91` | `:ARG1` possessor, `:ARG2` possessum |
| Y belongs to X | `belong-91` | `:ARG1` possessum, `:ARG2` possessor |
| there is X (in L) | `exist-91` | `:ARG1` location, `:ARG2` theme |
| X is a member of category Y | `have-role-91` | `:ARG1` X, `:ARG3` category |
| X holds title T in organization O | `have-org-role-92` | `:ARG1` X, `:ARG2` O, `:ARG3` T |
| X is the R (kin, friend) of Z | `have-rel-role-92` | `:ARG1` X, `:ARG2` Z, `:ARG3` R |
| X has quantity Q | `have-quant-91` | `:ARG1` X, `:ARG2` Q |
| cause, reason | `have-cause-91` / `:cause` | |

Role nouns are reified the same way: *the president of Russia* →
`(p / person :ARG1-of (h / have-org-role-92 :ARG2 (c / country ...) :ARG3 (p2 / president)))`;
*his wife* → `(p / person :ARG1-of (h / have-rel-role-92 :ARG2 p2 :ARG3 (w / wife)))`.

### 2.4 Pronouns and implicit participants

A pronoun is `person` or `thing` with person and number: 他 / *he* → `(p / person :refer-person 3rd
:refer-number singular)`; 我们 / *we* → `:refer-person 1st :refer-number plural`; 它 / *it* → `thing` with
3rd singular. A plural noun gets `:refer-number plural`. A Chinese zero subject or object that is clearly
recoverable may be added as such a node (aligned to no word) and linked by coreference.

### 2.5 Discourse relations (combining clauses)

- coordination: `(a / and :op1 ... :op2 ...)`, `or`;
- contrast: `(c / contrast-91 :ARG1 ... :ARG2 ...)`; *but* (但是, 却, 然而, 不过) `(b / but-91 :ARG1 ... :ARG2 ...)`.
  These frames take `:ARG1`/`:ARG2`, never `:op1`/`:op2`. A time word or adverbial of a clause attaches to that
  clause's event, never to the discourse frame;
- concession `:concession`, condition `:condition`, reason `:reason` (for 由于/因为 phrases giving the reason for a state, an action or a judgement), purpose `:purpose`,
  manner `:manner`, temporal sequence `:temporal (b / before :op1 ...)` / `after` / `consecutive`;
- *if* (如果, 只要) → `:condition` on the main event; *because* (因为, 由于) → `:reason`; *in order to* (为了)
  → `:purpose`; *although* (虽然, 尽管) → `:concession`.

### 2.6 Multi-word expressions

An idiom, a phrasal verb or a fixed expression is one concept (`look-up-05`, `give-up-07`; a Chinese chengyu
is one concept). A discontinuous word (帮……忙) is one concept aligned to its span.

## 3. Relations

**Participant roles** (Stage 1): the numbered roles of the predicate's roleset, `:ARG0` (agent, causer,
experiencer as initiator), `:ARG1` (patient, theme), `:ARG2`–`:ARG5` as the roleset defines them. Use the
inverse `:ARGn-of` for a relative clause or a participant nominal: 卖菜的人 → `(p / person :ARG0-of (m /
卖-01 :ARG1 (c / 菜)))`.

**Non-participant roles** (closed list, the frequent ones): `:mod` (property, demonstrative, typifying
modifier), `:possessor`, `:part` / `:part-of`, `:topic`, `:temporal` (time expression or event),
`:place`, `:direction`, `:path`, `:goal`, `:source`, `:start`, `:manner`, `:instrument`, `:cause`,
`:reason`, `:purpose`, `:condition`, `:concession`, `:duration`, `:frequency`, `:extent`, `:degree`,
`:quant`, `:unit`, `:ord`, `:range`, `:age`, `:medium`, `:companion`, `:beneficiary`, `:example`,
`:subset-of`, `:name`, `:wiki`, `:opN`, `:vocative`, `:polite`, `:other-role` (when none fits).

Reported speech and thought: the reported event is the `:ARG1` of the reporting verb, as in AMR. The
UMR release data also marks it with `:quote <reporting event>` when the content is a quotation.

### 3.1 Attachment rules (frequent errors)

- Every adverb that carries meaning (*already, still, also, all/both*; 已经, 仍, 也, 都, 均) gets its own node,
  attached as `:mod` to the predicate it scopes over, not to a noun.
- A modifier that applies to each of several coordinated nouns is placed on each conjunct with the same variable
  (re-entrancy), not once on the `and` node.
- Fill only the arguments the syntax provides. Do not borrow a participant from elsewhere in the sentence for a
  noun compound or a nominal event; in a compound "N1-verb N2", the role is filled by the compound's own noun.
- "Known/famous for X" (…而闻名, 以…著称): the famous entity is the `:ARG1` of the fame predicate, attached as
  `:ARG1-of` on that noun, and the X clause is `:reason` of it, with that noun as its agent. When such a clause
  follows "A is a B", attach it inside the B noun, not as a separate conjunct.
- Role choice for noun modifiers: a country, city or place modifying a noun → `:place`; a channel or medium
  (TV, radio, network, print) → `:medium`; an edition, section or component of a whole → `:part-of` (not
  `:possessor`).
- Comparatives and superlatives use `have-degree-91`: *the most P X* → `(x / X :ARG1-of (h / have-degree-91
  :ARG2 (p / P) :ARG3 (m / most)))` (Chinese: `:ARG3 (m / 最)`); *more P than Y* adds `:ARG4 Y`. Use `:degree`
  only for plain intensifiers (very, too; 很, 非常, 太).
- A property word or chengyu used attributively ("absurd content", X 的 Y with X a property) is a `:mod` concept,
  not an event: it gets no aspect and no temporal or modal links.

## 4. Attributes

### 4.1 Aspect (`:aspect`, on every event)

Decide in this order before using the table:
1. Is the event a routine or recurring practice of its subject (an organisation or periodical publishing,
   reporting, compiling, broadcasting)? → `habitual`. This holds whatever the tense, and also under an
   aspectual verb (continue, stop).
2. Does a completive or aspectual predicate (*has already stopped, has ended*) describe a present condition? → `state`.
3. Is the event a process noun, including the object of a light or experiential verb (经, 经过, 进行, undergo)? → `process`.
4. Is it a verb of naming or labelling (*is called X*, 被称为)? → `performance`.

Otherwise use the coarse values:

| value | use for |
|---|---|
| `state` | states: non-verbal predicates (2.3), *be, have, know, want, like, believe*, 是, 有, 在, 知道, 喜欢, 认为 |
| `habitual` | an event that happens usually or repeatedly (*he walks to work*, 经常, 每天) |
| `activity` | an ongoing process with no evidence of an end (*is running*, 正在, 着; a present-tense process; most generic statements of what is done) |
| `endeavor` | a process that ended without reaching its result (*worked on it for a week*, stop doing) |
| `performance` | a process that ended and reached its result: completed past events (*denied*, *was arrested*, 了, 过) |
| `process` | an event nominal, or a process whose type cannot be told (*the meeting*, 探索 as a noun) |

Finer values (`inceptive`, `directed-activity`, `semelfactive`, ...) exist in the full guideline; use them
only when they are clear.

### 4.2 Polarity, mode, degree, quantity

- Negation: `:polarity -` on the negated concept (没, 不, 未, *not, never*); the event's modal strength is
  then negative (5.2). A negator fused into a verb (未经-type verbs: "without having undergone") gives no
  `:polarity`. The verb is `full-negative` in the modal layer. Events nested under it do not inherit the
  negation; check the gold data for their strength.
- `:mode imperative` (commands, 请, 别), `:mode interrogative` (questions; the questioned argument is
  `amr-unknown`, a yes/no question gets `:polarity amr-unknown`), `:mode expressive` (interjections).
- `:degree` for intensifiers and downtoners (*very, too, most*; 很, 非常, 太, 最) as a concept:
  `:degree (v / very)`.
- `:quant` for numbers and quantifiers (`:quant 3`, `:quant (a / all)`).

## 5. Document level

The document-level annotation of sentence N is one graph `(sNs0 / sentence ...)` with up to three lists of
`(parent :relation child)` triples. The triples of sentence N have at least one node of sentence N; the
other end can be a node of an earlier sentence or a constant.

### 5.1 Temporal (`:temporal`)

A dependency structure: each event and each time expression gets **one reference time** as its parent, and
the relation says where the **child** is relative to the **parent**:

- `:before` (child before parent), `:after` (child after parent), `:overlap` (child and parent overlap),
  `:contained` (child inside parent), `:contains`, `:depends-on` (between time nodes).
- Constants: `document-creation-time`, `past-reference`, `present-reference`, `future-reference`, `root`.
- **Which nodes get a temporal parent.** Only real eventive predicates and specific time expressions. Do NOT
  give a temporal parent to:
  - copular or identity predicates (`identity-91`, `have-role-91` of a defining "A is a B" sentence);
  - states used as attributes inside a noun phrase (*famous X*, a relative-clause state);
  - property modifiers;
  - vague deictic time words (*now, currently, nowadays*, 现在, 目前, 当前).
- Precision counts as much as recall: when a link is not clear, leave it out.
- Time expressions: an absolute date (*1998*) depends on `root`; a relative one (*today, yesterday*,
  今天) depends on `document-creation-time` — `(document-creation-time :depends-on s1t)`.
- **Within a sentence, chain the events.** Pick one anchor event (usually the main eventive predicate) and link
  the other events of the sentence to it: `:overlap` for simultaneous states, `:contained` for a state or event
  inside its span, `:before`/`:after` for sequence. Only the anchor links to `document-creation-time` or to an
  earlier sentence's event. For the main event of a sentence describing the present situation, the gold data
  often uses `(document-creation-time :depends-on e)`; check with `search_annotations`.
- Then every event: (1) a time expression of its clause, if there is one (`(s1t :contained s1e)`); else
  (2) an event before it that is a clear reference time (`(s2c :before s3a)`); else (3)
  `document-creation-time` (`(document-creation-time :before s3d)` for a past event, `:overlap` for a
  present state, `:after` for a future event). Chinese has no tense: decide past, present or future from
  context, 了, 过, 将, 会.
- An event in a complement clause takes its matrix event as parent; a purpose is `:after` its main event.
- Annotate event–event relations only when they are clear.

### 5.2 Modal (`:modal`)

A dependency structure of conceivers and events: `(conceiver :strength event)`, starting with
`(root :modal author)` in every sentence that has events.

- Strength = the conceiver's certainty that the event happens or holds: `full-affirmative` (plain
  assertion, *will*), `partial-affirmative` (*probably, must, should*, 应该, 可能性大, 一定 as inference),
  `neutral-affirmative` (*may, might, perhaps, can*, 可能, 也许, 或许, desire/hope), `neutral-negative`,
  `partial-negative`, `full-negative` (negated: *not, never, deny*, 没, 不), `unspecified`.
- Every event the author asserts: `(author :full-affirmative s1e)`.
- Reported speech or thought: the author is certain of the speaker, the speaker of the content:
  `(author :full-affirmative s9p)` `(s9p :full-affirmative s9s3)`, where `s9p` is the speaker (a person
  node, or an event used as conceiver).
- An event under a modal or complement-taking predicate (*want, try, plan, decide, hope*, 想, 希望, 打算,
  决定, 需要): the predicate is asserted by the author, the complement has the predicate as parent with
  `unspecified` (or the strength the predicate implies): `(author :full-affirmative s3w)`
  `(s3w :unspecified s3g)`.
- A conceiver that is not in the text is `null-conceiver`. Purpose and condition clauses may use the
  constants `purpose` and `have-condition` as parents of their events.
- In the sentence graph, write the strength of an event that is not `full-affirmative` from the author as
  `:modal-strength <value>` too (the scorers move it to the document level).

### 5.3 Coreference (`:coref`)

- `(earlier :same-entity later)`: two mentions of the same entity — a pronoun and its antecedent, a repeated
  name, a definite description. Link each mention to its closest earlier mention, earlier one first;
  link entity nodes, never `name` nodes.
- `(earlier :same-event later)`: two mentions of the same event instance, with the same participants. Two
  different events of similar meaning (e.g. two different kinds of stopping) are not linked.
- `(a :subset-of b)`: the entity or event a is a subset or part of b.
- Within one sentence, coreference is a re-entrancy in the graph (one variable), not a `:coref` triple.

## 6. Alignment

Every node of a sentence graph is aligned to the words that express it: `s1x: 4-4` (1-based word positions,
first and last, both included). A node with no word in the sentence (`person` for a zero pronoun, `and`
without a conjunction, `have-mod-91` without a copula, a `name` node) is `0-0`. A named entity's type
node is aligned to the name's words.

## 7. Checklist

- Parentheses balanced; every variable defined once; all variables start with `s<N>`.
- Every event has `:aspect`; negated events have `:polarity -`.
- Every event and time expression has a temporal parent; every event has a modal parent.
- Coreference across sentences is in `:coref`; within a sentence it is a re-entrancy.

# The critique (training batch 1: chinese_umr-0001, sentences 1-5; AnCast++ comprehensive 72.9)
<critique>
# Review of the UMR annotation instruction: error patterns, costs and fixes

Patterns are ordered by cost, most costly first. Unit counts come from the judge's list of failed units.

## 1. Temporal links within a sentence (h_temporal F 50, about 9 units)

**What went wrong:**
- **Wrong anchor (3 wrong links).** One sentence had a relative clause with an aspectual verb over a habitual event (an "already stopped publishing" type), plus a fame predicate and its reason event. The annotator anchored on the aspectual verb. It placed the habitual event `:before` it and linked the reason event to the document creation time separately. Gold anchors on the inner habitual event: document creation time `:before` it. The aspectual verb `:overlap`s it, the fame state is `:contained` in it, and the reason event `:overlap`s it.
- **Present-situation sentences (2 units).** Two main events describe the present: a lexical "has ceased" verb with "currently", and a naming verb. The annotator used `(document-creation-time :overlap e)`. Gold uses `:depends-on`. The instruction only says gold "often" does this, and the annotator did not check.
- **Missing parents (2 units).** A process nominal under a verb got no temporal parent. The comparison event that the annotator never created (see 6) also had none.

**Why:** "Pick one anchor, usually the main eventive predicate" gives no guidance when the only real events sit inside a noun phrase. It also says nothing about aspectual verbs. "Precision counts as much as recall: leave it out" pushed the annotator to drop the nominal event.

**Change:**
- When an aspectual verb (stop, continue, begin) takes an event, make the inner event the anchor. The aspectual verb, and any states or reasons that hang on that event, link to it with `:overlap` or `:contained`.
- Link every event of the sentence to the anchor. Do not give a second event its own link to the document creation time.
- Make the present-situation rule firm. For the main event of a sentence about the current state (with "currently", "already", or a naming or labelling verb in the present), write `(document-creation-time :depends-on e)`, not `:overlap`.
- A process nominal that is an argument of a verb takes that verb as its parent, with `:overlap`.

## 2. Participants borrowed or invented: extra re-entrancies (g_reentrancy P 44; d_core_args_event and abstract; about 7 units)

**What went wrong:**
- **Relative clause with an aspectual verb.** For "N that has stopped V-ing", the annotator attached the noun as `:ARG1-of` the aspectual verb. It then also put the noun as `:ARG1` of the inner verb, giving a double edge. Gold: the noun is `:ARG1-of` the inner verb, and the inner verb is `:ARG1-of` the aspectual verb, so the noun is not filled twice.
- **Zero subject filled anyway.** A clause with a dropped subject got an `:ARG0` pointing back to the named entity. Gold leaves it unfilled.
- **Invented relations.** The annotator added `:part-of` from a "web edition" noun to the publication, which gold does not have. It also added a non-existent `:subset` role between a partitive phrase ("among them, many items") and an earlier conjunction.

**Why:** The "fill only the arguments the syntax provides" rule is stated only for compounds and nominals.

**Change:**
- Extend that rule to dropped subjects and objects of finite clauses in a coordinate or contrast structure. Do not add a re-entrancy to an earlier mention. Leave the argument out unless the guidelines' zero-pronoun rule clearly applies.
- For a relative clause headed by an aspectual verb, attach the head noun to the inner verb, and attach the aspectual verb to the inner verb with `:ARG1-of`.
- A partitive word ("among them", "of which") is a `:mod` on the noun it modifies. Use only roles from the closed list.

## 3. Negator fused into a verb (未经-type) (concept, aspect, two role labels, nested modal; about 7 units)

**What went wrong:**
- **Concept and roles.** The annotator made the concept `<negated word>-00` with `:ARG1`/`:ARG2` and aspect `state`. Gold uses the positive verb's sense from PropBank (the 经-type verb), its own `:ARG0`/`:ARG1`, and aspect `process`.
- **"N1-verification procedure" compound.** The annotator attached the event as `:mod` of the procedure noun. Gold reifies it as an identity: procedure `:ARG0-of identity-91 :ARG1 <event>`.
- **Nested event under the negated verb.** Gold gives it `partial-affirmative`. The annotator gave `full-affirmative`, although the instruction told it to check the gold data.

**Change:**
- State that for a negator fused into a verb, the concept is the un-negated verb with its PropBank sense and roles, its aspect follows the verb (`process` for 经-type verbs), and the verb is `full-negative`.
- Say explicitly that an event nested under such a verb gets `partial-affirmative` from the author.
- For "a [process noun] [procedure/method/system]" apposition-like compounds, use `identity-91` linking the head noun to the event.

## 4. Aspect (c_aspect F 79, 3 units)

**What went wrong:**
- A possession verb with "once" and an experiential marker (过) got `performance`. Gold gives `state`: possession stays a state even when it is past and bounded.
- A lexical "cease publication" verb with "already" got `state` under rule 2. Gold gives `performance`. Rule 2 applies only to an aspectual verb taking an event complement.
- The fused-negation verb got `state` (see 3).

**Change:**
- Restrict rule 2 to aspectual verbs that take an event complement.
- A lexical verb of ending (closing down, ceasing publication) with "already" is `performance`.
- Add: state verbs (have, own, belong, be) remain `state` with 过, 曾经 or a duration.

## 5. `:wiki` added (f_wiki P 0, 4 units)

Gold Chinese data has no `:wiki`. The word "optional" in the instruction invites adding it.

**Change:** For Chinese documents, write no `:wiki`.

## 6. Superlative over a verb, and "in X's history" (core_args_abstract, missing event, missing entity, temporal and modal; about 6 units)

**What went wrong:**
- **Superlative.** In "most-[verb] [noun]" (a "richest in creativity" type), the annotator dropped the verb. It made the noun the `:ARG2` of `have-degree-91` and added an `:ARG5`. Gold: `:ARG2 (verb-01 :ARG1 noun :aspect state)`.
- **"In X's history".** Gold has `:temporal (上 :op1 历史)`, with the country as `:place` of the history noun. The annotator used `:mod`, although the place rule exists.
- **Modal link.** The annotator gave the abstract `have-degree-91` a modal link. Gold gives it none; the verb inside it gets the link.

**Change:**
- When the degree word modifies a verb, that verb is the `:ARG2` of `have-degree-91`, as an event with its own aspect, temporal parent and modal parent.
- A locative postposition phrase over a time-span noun ("in history", 历史上) is `:temporal` of the head noun, with the postposition as the concept and `:op1` the noun.
- Do not give `have-degree-91` a modal link.
- Make the place rule apply to every noun, abstract nouns included.

## 7. Smaller role and label choices (about 6 units)

- **Belong-type verb in a relative clause:** the annotator inverted the roles. In gold the owned thing is `:ARG0` and the owner `:ARG1`. Tell the annotator to read the roleset rather than assume possessum = `:ARG1`.
- **Channel noun ("TV programme"):** the annotator used `:mod`, but it should be `:medium`. The rule exists but was not applied; repeat it in the checklist.
- **"Once" / "formerly" (曾经):** gold uses `:temporal`, not `:mod`. Add it to the list of time adverbs, separate from scope adverbs like "also" and "already".
- **Entity type:** a periodical or tabloid name should be `newspaper`, not `publication` (2 units).
- **Coordination with mixed separators:** when the first two items are joined without the list comma (、) and the rest with it, gold nests the first pair as its own `and` (1 unit).
- **Coreference of a country name used as a modifier:** the annotator linked it across sentences, but gold does not link it (2 coref precision units). Coreference only the discourse entities that the text tracks.

## What the instruction got right and should keep

These checks were at 100:
- event senses;
- polarity and other attributes;
- name tokens, with the title marks as their own `:op`s;
- numeral + classifier `:unit`;
- document format.

These were also handled well:
- `identity-91` for "A is a B";
- the "famous for" rule (`:ARG1-of` the fame predicate, with `:reason` inside the noun);
- `habitual` for a publication's regular output;
- `but-91` with `:ARG1`/`:ARG2`;
- `:reason` for 由于 phrases;
- re-entrancy of a shared modifier on each conjunct;
- `:part-of` for an edition of a work;
- `performance` for naming verbs;
- `full-negative` on the negated verb;
- the coreference chain of the main entity.

Keep these rules as they are.

# Earlier edits
- batch 1, reflection 1 (8/8 edits applied): Restrict and chain temporal links; aspect decision order; adverb/modifier attachment and re-entrancy rules; non-core role choices (:place, :medium, :part-of, :reason); classifiers kept as :unit; title brackets in names; have-degree-91 for comparison; but-91/contrast-91 take ARG1/ARG2; stricter same-event and fused-negation rules. -> AnCast++ comp 72.9 on the batch, kept

# Your answer
A short summary of what you change and why, then one JSON block (```json ... ```) of the form
{"summary": "...", "edits": [...]}, where each edit is one of
  {"op": "replace", "old": "<text that occurs exactly once>", "new": "<its replacement>"}
  {"op": "insert_after", "anchor": "<text that occurs exactly once>", "text": "<text to insert after it>"}
  {"op": "append", "text": "<text to add at the end>"}
  {"op": "delete", "old": "<text that occurs exactly once>"}
  {"op": "rewrite", "text": "<the whole new instruction>"}  (only to consolidate; then no other edit)
Edits apply in order; one whose anchor is not found exactly once is skipped.
