<!-- user -->
You are improving the instruction an annotator (a model) follows to annotate whole documents in Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR). It is scored against expert gold annotations; the score that counts is AnCast++ (sentence graphs and document-level relations). Below are the current instruction, a critique of its annotation of a training batch, and what earlier edits did.

Edit the instruction to fix the problems of the critique that will recur on other documents. Prefer few, high-value changes; keep what works; keep the instruction clear and consistent (fix a rule rather than adding a contradicting one). The output format and the tools' descriptions are fixed and not part of the instruction: do not restate or change them. The instruction may be at most 30000 characters (now 25014). Never copy text of the test documents. Write general rules only. Do not record details: no specific words, names, sentences or annotations of these sentences, and no examples taken from them (short schematic patterns such as X 的 Y or (x / ...-01 :ARG0 ...) are fine). An edit that copies 8 or more characters of the training document is rejected.

# Skill: the UMR of a whole document

You annotate a whole document in Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR): every sentence's sentence-level
graph, then all the document-level relations (temporal, modal, coreference) of the document. The document
is under **Input** at the end, one sentence per line.

**Make the annotation as correct as you can.** It is compared, node by node and relation by relation,
with an expert gold annotation made by these guidelines, so every concept, sense, role, attribute value
and document-level relation counts. Take the time this needs:

- Read the guidelines below carefully before you start, and go back to them for every decision you are
  not sure of: the concept and its sense, the numbered and non-core roles, abstract concepts and named
  entities, aspect, modal strength, polarity, and the temporal, modal and coreference relations.
- Follow the examples: when a sentence has a construction an example shows, annotate it the way the
  example does.
- Do not guess when you can check: use the three tools (see Tools): search the full guidelines with
  `search_guidelines` whenever the guidelines above do not settle a case, look up every predicate in
  PropBank with `propbank_lookup` before you choose its sense and numbered roles, and look up how the gold
  data annotates a construction, a word or a relation with `search_annotations`. Call them as often as you
  need: many calls are expected.
- Before you go on to the next sentence, check the graph against the guidelines once more: every word
  that carries meaning has its concept, every event its aspect, every role the right direction; and at
  the end check that the document-level relations cover every event and entity the guidelines ask for.

## Guidelines

# UMR guidelines, abridged

A short version of the UMR 0.9 specification (`umr_guidelines.md` in this folder, umr4nlp/umr-guidelines),
for annotating Chinese and English at Stage 1 (numbered PropBank roles). It keeps what an annotator needs for
most sentences and leaves out the typological material, the fine-grained lattices, the field-linguistics
sections and most of the examples. Where the full guideline uses the older short names (`AUTH`, `DCT`,
`FullAff`, `:modstr`, `:ref-person`, `Performance`), this version uses the names of the UMR release data
(`author`, `document-creation-time`, `full-affirmative`, `:modal-strength`, `:refer-person`, `performance`).

## 1. What a UMR is

A UMR has two levels.

- **Sentence level**: one rooted, directed graph per sentence in PENMAN notation, adapted from AMR:
  concepts (events, entities, abstract concepts), the relations between them (participant roles and
  non-participant roles) and attributes (aspect, polarity, mode, quantity, person and number, degree).
- **Document level**: three kinds of relations between the nodes of the sentence graphs, across sentences:
  **temporal** dependencies, **modal** dependencies, and **coreference**.

```
He denied any wrongdoing.

(s3d / deny-01
    :ARG0 (s3p / person
        :refer-person 3rd
        :refer-number singular)
    :ARG1 (s3d2 / do-02
        :ARG0 s3p
        :ARG1 (s3t / thing
            :mod (s3a / any)
            :ARG1-of (s3w / wrong-02))
        :aspect process)
    :aspect performance)

(s3s0 / sentence
    :temporal ((document-creation-time :before s3d)
               (s3d :before s3d2))
    :modal ((root :modal author)
            (author :full-affirmative s3p)
            (s3p :full-affirmative s3d)
            (s3d :unspecified s3d2))
    :coref ((s2p :same-entity s3p)))
```

**Variables.** Every node of sentence N has a variable starting with `s` + N (`s3d`, `s3p`, `s3d2`), all
different within the document. A node that fills two roles is written once and then referred to by its
variable (re-entrancy: `:ARG0 s3p` above).

## 2. Concepts

### 2.1 Events

An event is a process or a state that is **predicated**, or a process used to **refer or modify**:

- verbs used as predicates (`deny-01`, Chinese `拥有-01`);
- event nominals with process meaning (*the meeting*, *the attack*, 会议, 比赛) — annotate them as events;
- participles and relative-clause verbs (*the man who left*: `(p / person :ARG0-of (l / leave-11))`);
- predicated states: adjectives and nouns in predicate position (*he is tall*, 他很高) — through the
  abstract predicates of 2.3 when there is no lexical verb.

Not events: entity nouns, property words used as plain modifiers (*a tall man*: `:mod (t / tall)`),
auxiliaries and modal verbs (*will, can, must*; 会, 能, 可以, 应该 — they affect `:aspect` and modal
strength, they are not nodes), light verbs (*make a decision* → `decide-01`; 进行访问 → `访问-01`),
the copula (*be*, 是) — it becomes one of the abstract predicates.

**Concept names.** An English event is its PropBank roleset (`deny-01`, `look-up-05`). A Chinese event is the
Chinese word as written with its Chinese PropBank sense (`拥有-01`, `执行-01`); a Chinese predicate that is not
in PropBank is `<word>-00`. Entities and modifiers are the word itself, lemmatized in English (`doctor`, `health`) and as
written in Chinese (`宇航员`, `航天器`). Use English only for the abstract concepts below and for entity
types (`person`, `thing`, `country`, `city`, `organization`, ...).

### 2.2 Named entities

`(c / country :wiki "Russia" :name (n / name :op1 "Russia"))`: an entity-type concept, an optional `:wiki`
(the Wikipedia title, or `-` when there is none), and `:name` with one `:opN` per word of the name.
Chinese names are split into words, not characters: 欧洲议会 → `:op1 "欧洲" :op2 "议会"`. In Chinese documents write **no** `:wiki` at all. A periodical, tabloid or magazine name is `newspaper`, not `publication`. Types: `person`,
`country`, `city`, `province`, `state`, `nationality`, `ethnic-group`, `language`, `organization`,
`company`, `government-organization`, `political-party`, `university`, `newspaper`, `publication`, `river`,
`mountain`, `building`, `airport`, `road`, `event`, `war`, `conference`, `festival`, `award`, `law`,
`disease`, `product`, `spaceship`, ... (as in AMR).

Dates: `(d / date-entity :year 1998 :month 4 :day 3)`, also `:weekday`, `:season`, `:dayperiod`, `:era`,
`:decade`, `:century`. Durations and amounts: `(t / temporal-quantity :quant 3 :unit (y / year))`,
`(m / monetary-quantity :quant 500 :unit (d / dollar))`. Ordinals: `(o / ordinal-entity :value 2)`.
Numbers are written as digits. In Chinese, a numeral + measure word or classifier keeps the classifier as the unit,
ordinary classifiers included (个, 本, 只, 位, 份, 面): 三杯水 → `水 :quant 3 :unit 杯`, 一本书 → `书 :quant 1 :unit (s / 本)`.
A demonstrative + classifier (这个, 那份) also keeps the classifier as `:unit`.
The title marks of a work or publication name (《 and 》) are part of the name: `:op1 "《"`, then the words, then a last `:opN "》"`.

### 2.3 Abstract predicates (non-verbal clauses)

| construction | concept | roles |
|---|---|---|
| X is Y (identity, equation) | `identity-91` | `:ARG1` X, `:ARG2` Y |
| X is Adj / X has property | `have-mod-91` | `:ARG1` theme, `:ARG2` property |
| X is in/at place | `have-place-91` | `:ARG1` theme, `:ARG2` place |
| X has Y (possession) | `have-91` | `:ARG1` possessor, `:ARG2` possessum |
| Y belongs to X | `belong-91` | `:ARG1` possessum, `:ARG2` possessor |
| there is X (in L) | `exist-91` | `:ARG1` location, `:ARG2` theme |
| X is a member of category Y | `have-role-91` | `:ARG1` X, `:ARG3` category |
| X holds title T in organization O | `have-org-role-92` | `:ARG1` X, `:ARG2` O, `:ARG3` T |
| X is the R (kin, friend) of Z | `have-rel-role-92` | `:ARG1` X, `:ARG2` Z, `:ARG3` R |
| X has quantity Q | `have-quant-91` | `:ARG1` X, `:ARG2` Q |
| cause, reason | `have-cause-91` / `:cause` | |

Role nouns are reified the same way: *the president of Russia* →
`(p / person :ARG1-of (h / have-org-role-92 :ARG2 (c / country ...) :ARG3 (p2 / president)))`;
*his wife* → `(p / person :ARG1-of (h / have-rel-role-92 :ARG2 p2 :ARG3 (w / wife)))`.

### 2.4 Pronouns and implicit participants

A pronoun is `person` or `thing` with person and number: 他 / *he* → `(p / person :refer-person 3rd
:refer-number singular)`; 我们 / *we* → `:refer-person 1st :refer-number plural`; 它 / *it* → `thing` with
3rd singular. A plural noun gets `:refer-number plural`. A Chinese zero subject or object that is clearly
recoverable may be added as such a node (aligned to no word) and linked by coreference.

### 2.5 Discourse relations (combining clauses)

- coordination: `(a / and :op1 ... :op2 ...)`, `or`;
- contrast: `(c / contrast-91 :ARG1 ... :ARG2 ...)`; *but* (但是, 却, 然而, 不过) `(b / but-91 :ARG1 ... :ARG2 ...)`.
  These frames take `:ARG1`/`:ARG2`, never `:op1`/`:op2`. A time word or adverbial of a clause attaches to that
  clause's event, never to the discourse frame;
- concession `:concession`, condition `:condition`, reason `:reason` (for 由于/因为 phrases giving the reason for a state, an action or a judgement), purpose `:purpose`,
  manner `:manner`, temporal sequence `:temporal (b / before :op1 ...)` / `after` / `consecutive`;
- *if* (如果, 只要) → `:condition` on the main event; *because* (因为, 由于) → `:reason`; *in order to* (为了)
  → `:purpose`; *although* (虽然, 尽管) → `:concession`.

### 2.6 Multi-word expressions

An idiom, a phrasal verb or a fixed expression is one concept (`look-up-05`, `give-up-07`; a Chinese chengyu
is one concept). A discontinuous word (帮……忙) is one concept aligned to its span.

## 3. Relations

**Participant roles** (Stage 1): the numbered roles of the predicate's roleset, `:ARG0` (agent, causer,
experiencer as initiator), `:ARG1` (patient, theme), `:ARG2`–`:ARG5` as the roleset defines them. Use the
inverse `:ARGn-of` for a relative clause or a participant nominal: 卖菜的人 → `(p / person :ARG0-of (m /
卖-01 :ARG1 (c / 菜)))`.

**Non-participant roles** (closed list, the frequent ones): `:mod` (property, demonstrative, typifying
modifier), `:possessor`, `:part` / `:part-of`, `:topic`, `:temporal` (time expression or event),
`:place`, `:direction`, `:path`, `:goal`, `:source`, `:start`, `:manner`, `:instrument`, `:cause`,
`:reason`, `:purpose`, `:condition`, `:concession`, `:duration`, `:frequency`, `:extent`, `:degree`,
`:quant`, `:unit`, `:ord`, `:range`, `:age`, `:medium`, `:companion`, `:beneficiary`, `:example`,
`:subset-of`, `:name`, `:wiki`, `:opN`, `:vocative`, `:polite`, `:other-role` (when none fits).

Reported speech and thought: the reported event is the `:ARG1` of the reporting verb, as in AMR. The
UMR release data also marks it with `:quote <reporting event>` when the content is a quotation.

### 3.1 Attachment rules (frequent errors)

- Every adverb that carries meaning (*already, still, also, all/both*; 已经, 仍, 也, 都, 均) gets its own node,
  attached as `:mod` to the predicate it scopes over, not to a noun. Time adverbs (曾经, 曾, *once, formerly*) are
  `:temporal`, not `:mod`.
- A modifier that applies to each of several coordinated nouns is placed on each conjunct with the same variable
  (re-entrancy), not once on the `and` node.
- Fill only the arguments the syntax provides. Do not borrow a participant from elsewhere in the sentence for a
  noun compound or a nominal event; in a compound "N1-verb N2", the role is filled by the compound's own noun.
  The same holds for dropped subjects and objects of finite clauses (in coordination, contrast or a chain of clauses): do not
  add a re-entrancy to an earlier mention; leave the argument out. Do not add relations the text does not state (e.g. a
  `:part-of` the words do not express). Use only roles of the closed list; a partitive word (其中, *among them, of which*) is a
  `:mod` on the noun it modifies.
- Relative clause headed by an aspectual verb ("N that has stopped V-ing"): N is `:ARG1-of` (or `:ARG0-of`) the inner verb, and
  the aspectual verb is attached to the inner verb by `:ARG1-of`; N is not also an argument of the aspectual verb.
- Read the roleset for every role. For Chinese belong-type rolesets (X belongs to Y), the gold convention is: the thing that
  belongs = `:ARG0`, the owner = `:ARG1`, even where the PropBank role glosses seem to say the reverse. So "N that belongs to X"
  is `(n / N :ARG0-of (b / belong-verb :ARG1 X))`. Never assume possessum = `:ARG1`.
- Coordination with mixed separators: if the first two items are joined without 、 and the rest with 、, the first pair is its
  own nested `and` inside the outer `and`.
- "Known/famous for X" (…而闻名, 以…著称): the famous entity is the `:ARG1` of the fame predicate, attached as
  `:ARG1-of` on that noun, and the X clause is `:reason` of it, with that noun as its agent. When such a clause
  follows "A is a B", attach it inside the B noun, not as a separate conjunct.
- Role choice for noun modifiers: a country, city or place modifying a noun → `:place`; a channel or medium
  (TV, radio, network, print) → `:medium`; an edition, section or component of a whole → `:part-of` (not
  `:possessor`).
- Comparatives and superlatives use `have-degree-91`: *the most P X* → `(x / X :ARG1-of (h / have-degree-91
  :ARG2 (p / P) :ARG3 (m / most)))` (Chinese: `:ARG3 (m / 最)`); *more P than Y* adds `:ARG4 Y`. Use `:degree`
  only for plain intensifiers (very, too; 很, 非常, 太).
- When the degree word modifies a verb (*most rich in X*, 最富有X), that verb is the `:ARG2` of `have-degree-91` as an event
  with its own `:aspect` (`(r / verb-01 :ARG1 X :aspect state)`), temporal parent and modal parent; the head noun is `:ARG1`.
  Do not use `:ARG5` and give `have-degree-91` itself no modal link.
- A postposition phrase over a time-span noun (X 历史上, *in X's history*) is `:temporal (s / 上 :op1 (h / 历史))` on its head,
  with the country or place as `:place` of the history noun. The place rule holds for abstract nouns too.
- A property word or chengyu used attributively ("absurd content", X 的 Y with X a property) is a `:mod` concept,
  not an event: it gets no aspect and no temporal or modal links.

## 4. Attributes

### 4.1 Aspect (`:aspect`, on every event)

Decide in this order before using the table:
1. Is the event a routine or recurring practice of its subject (an organisation or periodical publishing,
   reporting, compiling, broadcasting)? → `habitual`. This holds whatever the tense, and also under an
   aspectual verb (continue, stop).
2. Does an aspectual verb of stopping or completion taking an event complement (*has already stopped doing X*) describe a present condition? → `state`.
   An aspectual verb of continuation or ongoing action in the present (*continues to do X*, 继续) is `activity`.
   A lexical verb of ending with no event complement (close down, cease publication; 停刊, 倒闭), even with *already*, is `performance`.
   State verbs (have, own, belong, be; 有, 拥有, 是) stay `state` even with 过, 曾经 or a duration.
3. Is the event a process noun, including the object of a light or experiential verb (经, 经过, 进行, undergo)? → `process`.
4. Is it a verb of naming or labelling (*is called X*, 被称为)? → `performance`.

Otherwise use the coarse values:

| value | use for |
|---|---|
| `state` | states: non-verbal predicates (2.3), *be, have, know, want, like, believe*, 是, 有, 在, 知道, 喜欢, 认为 |
| `habitual` | an event that happens usually or repeatedly (*he walks to work*, 经常, 每天) |
| `activity` | an ongoing process with no evidence of an end (*is running*, 正在, 着; a present-tense process; most generic statements of what is done) |
| `endeavor` | a process that ended without reaching its result (*worked on it for a week*, stop doing) |
| `performance` | a process that ended and reached its result: completed past events (*denied*, *was arrested*, 了, 过) |
| `process` | an event nominal, or a process whose type cannot be told (*the meeting*, 探索 as a noun) |

Finer values (`inceptive`, `directed-activity`, `semelfactive`, ...) exist in the full guideline; use them
only when they are clear.

### 4.2 Polarity, mode, degree, quantity

- Negation: `:polarity -` on the negated concept (没, 不, 未, *not, never*); the event's modal strength is
  then negative (5.2). A negator fused into a verb (未经-type verbs: "without having undergone") gives no
  `:polarity`. The verb is `full-negative` in the modal layer. Events nested under it do not inherit the
  negation: an event nested under the fused-negation verb gets `partial-affirmative`, with `author` as its modal parent (not the negated verb). The concept of a fused-negation verb is the
  un-negated verb with its own PropBank sense and roles (未经 → the 经-type verb's sense, with `:ARG0`/`:ARG1`), never `<negated word>-00`;
  its aspect follows that verb (`process` for 经/经过-type verbs). A compound "[process noun] + procedure/method/system noun" is
  reified as identity: `(p / procedure-noun :ARG0-of (i / identity-91 :ARG1 <event>))`, not `:mod`.
- `:mode imperative` (commands, 请, 别), `:mode interrogative` (questions; the questioned argument is
  `amr-unknown`, a yes/no question gets `:polarity amr-unknown`), `:mode expressive` (interjections).
- `:degree` for intensifiers and downtoners (*very, too, most*; 很, 非常, 太, 最) as a concept:
  `:degree (v / very)`.
- `:quant` for numbers and quantifiers (`:quant 3`, `:quant (a / all)`).

## 5. Document level

The document-level annotation of sentence N is one graph `(sNs0 / sentence ...)` with up to three lists of
`(parent :relation child)` triples. The triples of sentence N have at least one node of sentence N; the
other end can be a node of an earlier sentence or a constant.

### 5.1 Temporal (`:temporal`)

A dependency structure: each event and each time expression gets **one reference time** as its parent, and
the relation says where the **child** is relative to the **parent**:

- `:before` (child before parent), `:after` (child after parent), `:overlap` (child and parent overlap),
  `:contained` (child inside parent), `:contains`, `:depends-on` (between time nodes).
- Constants: `document-creation-time`, `past-reference`, `present-reference`, `future-reference`, `root`.
- **Which nodes get a temporal parent.** Only real eventive predicates and specific time expressions. Do NOT
  give a temporal parent to:
  - copular or identity predicates (`identity-91`, `have-role-91` of a defining "A is a B" sentence);
  - fame or property states used as attributes inside a noun phrase (*famous X*; see the fame rule below);
  - property modifiers;
  - vague deictic time words (*now, currently, nowadays*, 现在, 目前, 当前).
- Precision counts as much as recall: when a link is not clear, leave it out.
- Time expressions: an absolute date (*1998*) depends on `root`; a relative one (*today, yesterday*,
  今天) depends on `document-creation-time` — `(document-creation-time :depends-on s1t)`.
- **Within a sentence, chain the events.** Pick one anchor event (usually the main eventive predicate) and link
  the other events of the sentence to it: `:overlap` for simultaneous states, `:contained` for a state or event
  inside its span, `:before`/`:after` for sequence. Only the anchor links to `document-creation-time` or to an
  earlier sentence's event. For the main event of a sentence describing the present situation, the gold data
  uses `(document-creation-time :depends-on e)`, not `:overlap`: a sentence about the current state (with currently/already, 目前/已经, or a present naming or labelling verb).
- **Aspectual verbs.** When an aspectual verb (stop, continue, begin; 停止, 继续, 开始) takes an event complement, the aspectual verb
  is the parent of the complement: `(aspectual :overlap inner)`. In a main clause the aspectual verb hangs on the sentence anchor like
  any other clause predicate; in a contrast or coordination it `:overlap`s the first clause's anchor event. Only when the aspectual verb
  is inside a relative clause is the inner event the anchor (e.g. `(document-creation-time :before inner)` for a past habit), with the
  aspectual verb `:overlap`ping it. Never use `:before`/`:after` between two clauses that both describe the present situation. Never
  give a second event of the sentence its own link to `document-creation-time`, except the relative-clause anchor just described.
- **"Famous for X" in a defining sentence.** The fame state gets no temporal parent of its own; it is the parent of the habitual
  relative-clause event: `(fame :contained habitual-event)`, and that event also keeps its own `document-creation-time` link. The reason
  event (X) hangs on the habitual event with `:overlap`, not on the fame state.
- Every node that carries `:aspect` gets a modal parent (normally `author :full-affirmative`). A relative-clause verb with an aspect
  ("N that belongs to X") also gets a temporal parent: `:overlap` with the event whose argument N is, or with the clause anchor.
  Copular and identity predicates get no temporal parent but do get a modal parent. Only property words used as plain `:mod`
  (no aspect) get no links.
- A process nominal that is an argument of a verb takes that verb as its temporal parent with `:overlap`; do not leave it without a parent.
- Then every event: (1) a time expression of its clause, if there is one (`(s1t :contained s1e)`); else
  (2) an event before it that is a clear reference time (`(s2c :before s3a)`); else (3)
  `document-creation-time` (`(document-creation-time :before s3d)` for a past event, `:overlap` for a
  present state, `:after` for a future event). Chinese has no tense: decide past, present or future from
  context, 了, 过, 将, 会.
- An event in a complement clause takes its matrix event as parent; a purpose is `:after` its main event.
- Annotate event–event relations only when they are clear.

### 5.2 Modal (`:modal`)

A dependency structure of conceivers and events: `(conceiver :strength event)`, starting with
`(root :modal author)` in every sentence that has events.

- Strength = the conceiver's certainty that the event happens or holds: `full-affirmative` (plain
  assertion, *will*), `partial-affirmative` (*probably, must, should*, 应该, 可能性大, 一定 as inference),
  `neutral-affirmative` (*may, might, perhaps, can*, 可能, 也许, 或许, desire/hope), `neutral-negative`,
  `partial-negative`, `full-negative` (negated: *not, never, deny*, 没, 不), `unspecified`.
- Every event the author asserts: `(author :full-affirmative s1e)`.
- Reported speech or thought: the author is certain of the speaker, the speaker of the content:
  `(author :full-affirmative s9p)` `(s9p :full-affirmative s9s3)`, where `s9p` is the speaker (a person
  node, or an event used as conceiver).
- An event under a modal or complement-taking predicate (*want, try, plan, decide, hope*, 想, 希望, 打算,
  决定, 需要): the predicate is asserted by the author, the complement has the predicate as parent with
  `unspecified` (or the strength the predicate implies): `(author :full-affirmative s3w)`
  `(s3w :unspecified s3g)`.
- A conceiver that is not in the text is `null-conceiver`. Purpose and condition clauses may use the
  constants `purpose` and `have-condition` as parents of their events.
- In the sentence graph, write the strength of an event that is not `full-affirmative` from the author as
  `:modal-strength <value>` too (the scorers move it to the document level).

### 5.3 Coreference (`:coref`)

- `(earlier :same-entity later)`: two mentions of the same entity — a pronoun and its antecedent, a repeated
  name, a definite description. Link each mention to its closest earlier mention, earlier one first;
  link entity nodes, never `name` nodes.
- `(earlier :same-event later)`: two mentions of the same event instance, with the same participants. Two
  different events of similar meaning (e.g. two different kinds of stopping) are not linked.
- `(a :subset-of b)`: the entity or event a is a subset or part of b.
- Coreference only the discourse entities the text tracks (participants, the topic entity). A name used only as a modifier
  (a country name modifying a noun, a place in a `:place` role) is not linked across sentences.
- Within one sentence, coreference is a re-entrancy in the graph (one variable), not a `:coref` triple.

## 6. Alignment

Every node of a sentence graph is aligned to the words that express it: `s1x: 4-4` (1-based word positions,
first and last, both included). A node with no word in the sentence (`person` for a zero pronoun, `and`
without a conjunction, `have-mod-91` without a copula, a `name` node) is `0-0`. A named entity's type
node is aligned to the name's words. When a word occurs more than once in a sentence (e.g. a common noun that also appears
inside a name), align each node to its own occurrence.

## 7. Checklist

- Parentheses balanced; every variable defined once; all variables start with `s<N>`.
- Every event has `:aspect`; negated events have `:polarity -`.
- Every event and time expression has a temporal parent; every event has a modal parent.
- Coreference across sentences is in `:coref`; within a sentence it is a re-entrancy.
- Channel nouns (TV, radio, network) modifying a noun are `:medium`; places are `:place`; no `:wiki` in Chinese.
- No borrowed participants: every re-entrancy is licensed by the syntax of that clause.

# The critique (training batch 2: chinese_umr-0001, sentences 6-10; AnCast++ comprehensive 61.3)
<critique>
# How the instruction should change, judging by this document

**Overview.** Coreference, polarity, granularity and the document format were perfect, and modal links were good (F 93). Two areas lost the most points: temporal links (F 19) and the structure of the long reason-and-purpose sentence (core arguments of events F 53, of abstract predicates 0, reentrancy precision 25). Quantity nouns came next. Most of the temporal loss comes from rules that the instruction states but that the gold data does not follow.

## 1. Temporal links: the date rule and same-time narrative links are wrong (h_temporal, about 15 units)

**What went wrong:**
- **Absolute dates.** All three were attached as `(root :depends-on date)`. Gold puts `(document-creation-time :before date)` for a past date.
- **Event under a date.** All three were linked to their date with `:contained`. Gold uses `:overlap`.
- **Anchor of a new narrative sentence.** It was hung on the previous sentence's event. Gold links the anchor to `document-creation-time :before`.
- **Main event versus its reason and purpose clauses:**
  - Purpose clauses were made `:after` the main event. Gold has them `:overlap`, because the purpose holds at the time of the action.
  - The reason event (a change announced for the future, but past relative to the document) was made `:after`. Gold places it before the main event.
- **Event inside a relative clause** ("left-over", "inherited"): annotated as `:overlap`; gold places it before the event it modifies.
- **Next-sentence result state** ("X also became a feature"): annotated `:after`; gold uses `:overlap` with the previous anchor.
- **Event nominals inside a "process+量" noun** got no temporal parent (2 units missing).

**Why:** The instruction directly says "an absolute date depends on root" and gives the example `(s1t :contained s1e)`. Its rule "a purpose is `:after` its main event" goes against the gold. The search_annotations results confirm the gold pattern: `document-creation-time :before s4x` and `(s7r :contained s7x)` occur, but `:before` from DCT is the norm in past narrative.

**Changes to make:**
- A past absolute date gets `(document-creation-time :before date)`. Use `:after` for a future date. Keep `:depends-on` only for relative deictic dates.
- An event in the clause of a date or time expression gets `(date :overlap event)`. Use `:contained` only when the time expression is clearly a long span and the event is a point in it.
- In a past narrative, the anchor event of each sentence links to `document-creation-time :before`. Link it to an earlier sentence's event only when the sentence explicitly follows from that event, e.g. "also became", "as a result". Then use `:overlap` unless the order is stated.
- A purpose clause `:overlap`s its main event; drop "purpose is `:after`". A reason or cause event comes before its result.
- An event in a relative clause or participle that describes an earlier completed event (left over, inherited, built) comes before the event that uses it.
- A future marker inside a reason clause about past events means future *relative to that past*. It does not mean after the main event.

## 2. Clauses joined by both a reason marker and a purpose marker (about 20 units across several checks)

**What went wrong:** The sentence had a reason marker paired with a result marker, plus a purpose marker. Gold reifies this as `have-reason-91 (:ARG1 result, :ARG2 cause, :aspect state)` and nests `have-purpose-91 (:ARG1 main event, :ARG2 purpose, :aspect state)` inside it. Both get `author :full-affirmative`. The annotator used `:reason` and `:purpose` roles, so it missed 2 abstract nodes, their 4 arguments, their aspects and their modal links. Search_annotations shows this reified pattern in other gold documents too.

**Why:** Section 2.5 maps reason and purpose markers only to roles.

**Change:** When a reason marker is paired with a result marker (因为…于是/所以, 由于…而), or when a clause has a marked purpose, use the reified `have-reason-91` or `have-purpose-91` as above, with `:aspect state` and an author modal link. Keep `:reason` and `:purpose` roles for unpaired phrases inside one clause.

## 3. Arguments borrowed from elsewhere in the sentence (g_reentrancy P 25; core arguments)

**What went wrong:** Three arguments were borrowed:
- the founder was made the agent of the purpose verb;
- the founder was made the possessor of the other periodical;
- the new periodical was made the agent of the "contain" clause.

Gold leaves the first two out. The third clause is attached as `:ARG0-of` on the noun it describes, a relative-clause reading.

**Why:** The instruction already forbids this, but only for "finite clauses in coordination". The annotator read it as not covering purpose clauses or possessors.

**Change:** Widen the rule. Never fill an argument of a purpose clause, an infinitive-like clause or a trailing clause with an entity from the main clause. Never add `:possessor` from a word like 旗下 ("under one's banner"); keep that word as a `:mod` concept. A trailing clause that describes the object just introduced (a new entity plus what it holds or does) is a relative clause: attach it with `:ARGn-of` on that object.

## 4. "Component of a named work" phrases and change-of-state verbs (about 10 units)

**What went wrong:** In "[colour] edition 的 《Name》", gold makes the component noun the head, `(版面 :mod 黑白 :part-of newspaper)`. The annotator made the named entity the head with `:mod` component, which also produced a mismatch in name alignment. In "由 X 改为 Y" (change from X to Y), gold puts X as `:ARG1`, the thing changed (component `:part-of` work), and Y as `:ARG2`. The annotator used `:source` for X and gave the periodical as `:ARG1`.

**Change:**
- When a component, edition or section noun modifies a named work through 的, the component noun is the head and the work is its `:part-of`.
- For change verbs with 由 X 改为/变为 Y, the original state X is `:ARG1` and the result Y is `:ARG2`. Never use `:source`.

## 5. Quantity nouns ("process + 量") and amounts (about 20 units across sentences 9 and 10)

**What went wrong:** Gold decomposes such a noun into `(量 :quant-of (verb-01 :ARG1 entity) :ARG1-of (have-quant-91 :ARG2 number :unit classifier))`, and the process gets a temporal `:overlap` with the main verb. The annotator kept a single compound noun with `:possessor`. It also turned the number into `thing :quant N :unit`, and in one case used `:ARG3`, which made a node mismatch.

**Caveat:** Another gold document keeps a "-量" compound whole, so state this as the convention when the first part is a clear verb.

**Change:** Split the quantity noun: `量` is the head, the verb is a separate event reached through `:quant-of`, and the owner of the quantity is that verb's `:ARG1` (not `:possessor`). A reached or fallen-to amount is `have-quant-91 :ARG1 <quantity noun> :ARG2 <number> :unit <classifier>`, attached to the quantity noun through `:ARG1-of`. Do not make it a separate `thing` argument of the verb.

## 6. Role nouns, apposition and person names (about 10 units)

**What went wrong:**
- **Founder title** ("founder" + name): gold is `individual-person` + `:ARG1-of have-org-role-91 :ARG3 (人 :ARG0-of 创始-00 :aspect performance)`. The annotator used `person`, `创始-01` and `:ARG0-of` directly, with `state` aspect.
- **Appositive in front of a name** ("its gossip tabloid 《N》"): gold is `named-entity :ARG1-of (identity-91 :ARG2 (head noun :mod …))`. The annotator dropped the head noun and one modifier.
- **Middle dot in a transliterated foreign name:** gold keeps "·" as its own `:opN`; the annotator dropped it.

**Changes:**
- Named humans are `individual-person` (the gold data uses this concept).
- A title or role noun in front of a name is `have-org-role-91 :ARG3 <role>`. A role noun built from a verb plus 人/者 is `人 :ARG0-of verb`, with `performance` aspect for a completed act.
- A descriptive noun phrase in apposition to a name is `identity-91`, with all its modifiers kept.
- Keep "·" as a name op.
- Always check that a Chinese verb's sense exists in PropBank. If it does not, use `-00`.

## 7. Aspect and modifier details (about 6 units)

**What went wrong:**
- The purpose verb was `performance`; gold has `activity`.
- The relative-clause past event was `state`; gold has `performance`.
- The capacity clause ("contain articles") was `habitual`; gold has `process`. The instruction's "periodical publishing → habitual" rule was over-applied here.
- A colour or style word modifying a process nominal was `:mod`; gold has `:manner`.
- "1980年代" (the 1980s) was given `:decade`; gold has `:era`.

**Changes:**
- A purpose or intended action is `activity`.
- A completed event in a participle or relative clause is `performance`.
- Limit the habitual rule to verbs of publishing or reporting, not to the capacity or content of a publication.
- A modifier that says *how* a process nominal is done is `:manner`.
- Follow the gold convention for decade expressions (`:era` in this data).

## What to keep
- Named-entity handling: periodical names as `newspaper`, title marks as ops, no `:wiki`.
- Same-entity coreference chains to the closest earlier mention, including the "该刊" (this periodical) type of mention: 100%.
- `:polarity -` with `full-negative`, and an author modal link on every event.
- `:mod` for adverbs such as 也 and 已经; date-entities inside the clause; classifier as `:unit`.
- The sense and aspect of the main events (founding, became, reached, fell).
